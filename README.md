# Cross Selling and Up Selling with Deep Learning - Farmácias São João

This project was created in collaboration with Farmácias São João, one of the largest pharmaceutical retailers in South Brazil. The dataset was provided by Farmácias São João and is composed of over 9 million real and anonymized transactions from a selection of stores in Porto Alegre, Brazil, spanning January to June 2024. The objectives of the project were as follows:

1. Perform **Cross-Selling** recommendations for a user, considering the user's past purchases and current products in their cart.
2. Perform **Up-Selling** recommendations for a user, considering the user's past purchases and current products in their cart.
3. Create a **profile** for each user to better understand their purchase behavior, thereby improving general recommendations.
